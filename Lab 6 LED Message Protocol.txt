Lab 06

This lab's custom UDP client/server protocol allows a user to control LEDs on one PIC Ethernet board from another board or other device. Destination IP and port may be set at each board's HTML interface. 
The LED protocol messages have three major components:
    - The first part is an 8-bit CRC-8 code which is used to validate the remainder of the message. 
    - The second part is the LED number on the board. This board and program only supports LED_01_, LED_02_, and LED_03_. This can easily be expanded for more LEDs or even other devices.
    - The third part is whether to enable, disable, or toggle the chosen LED on the client. If toggle, the LED current status must be read and then negated. 

These messages are the form of:
    [1-char CRC code]LED_[2-digit number]_[ENA(ble) | DIS(able) | TOG(gle)]

Examples:
    [0x29]LED_01_ENA
    [0x2A]LED_02_DIS
    [0x2B]LED_03_TOG

Notes:
    - CRC-8 uses size of 4 with the equation x^8 + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 or hex code 0x187
	- The buttons on the board can only send _TOG messages. If a more complex system is used (e.g. a computer or a board with more buttons), this can be expanded to allow access to _ENA and _DIS messages.
